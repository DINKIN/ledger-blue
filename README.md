# Ledger Blue

The Ledger Blue is a personal lightweight mobile device architectured around a ST31 secure element, featuring a touch screen and USB/NFC/BLE connectivity. By enforcing a "what you see is what you sign" policy through a trusted interface the Blue strongly mitigates phishing and malware attacks.

The Blue is available now as a [developer edition in pre-order](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/9-ledger-blue), with a scheduled delivery end of January 2016.

This repo will be updated in the coming weeks with documentation and code examples for both native and client applications.
